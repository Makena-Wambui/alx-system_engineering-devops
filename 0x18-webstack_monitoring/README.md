Server monitoring can have different objectives and track diferent Key Performance Indicators(KPIs) based on 
the server.

However, the primary objective of Server Monitoring is to protect the server from possible failure that would interrupt
service availability.

As an IT organization grows both in size and number of deployments, you will need to select and configure a server monitoring tool that regularly collects data from each of your servers.

Leading server monitoring software tools can pull event logs for many types of servers such as web, application and network servers.

 For ex Sumo Logic, Data Dog.....

HOW DOES IT WORK?
==================
The exact server monitoring workflow will depend on the server monitoring software solution you have chosen, and the
cloud based server you are trying to monitor.

The general process of server monitoring can be described in 5 steps:
	1. identify the most important KPIs
--------------------------------------------------
-> Identify what data you want to track on each server.
	The data you choose here depends on the server's functionality for your organization.
	Application server : the most critical KPIs are availability and responsiveness
	Web server: capacity and speed
	Data storage server: latency, data throughput and data loss.
	2. set baseline KPI values:
---------------------------------------------------
The next step is to measure the performance of the server on each KPI metric, and determine the acceptable range of values for each KPI.
This initial measurement will act as a baseline against which the future performance of the server will be measured.

	3. Configure data collection and analysis:
--------------------------------------------------------
The server monitoring tool must be appropriately configured to pull data from the servers that it is monitoring.
The tool tracks activity on the server by streaming event logs(log files), automatically generated by the server.

Log files-> contain infor about errors, user activity and security events that happen on the server.

They also track server OS KPIS: CPU and memory availability, network connectivity and disk performance.

	4. Set up comprehensive and specific alerts:
------------------------------------------------------------
After configuring data collection and aggregation, build an alert system that sends out notifications to you and the team when there is a KPI breach, and the chosen metrics drop below threshhold levels.

	5. Get ready to respond
--------------------------------------
Outline policy and procedure for responding to alerts.
	. Who shd be responsible for investigating security alerts?
	. Who shd find solutions to operational issues?
	. What kind of alerts shd warrant a response, and how urgent shd the response be?
So define how the organization will treat each kind of event notification.

Server Monitoring Tools can pull event logs for different types of servers:
	1. 	Web server:
		============
		A web server delivers web pages.
		Have a unique ip address and domain name that corresponds to the website they host.
		Popular performance metrics and KPIS for web servers:
		1. Uptime
		2. Search query response time.
		3. Time to first byte
		4. Complete page load time
		5. Bounce rate
	2.	Application server
		===================
		Common metrics for application server monitoring:
		1. Resources usage
	 	2. Data throughput
		3. Latency of responses
		4. service failures and restarts
		5. error rates and success rates.
		6. overall application availability.
	3. Network servers:
	=====================
		Act as a central hub, help other machines on the network access additional computing
		resources like: processing power, disk space and printers on an on demand basis.
		Can also be used to store files, or
		run applications from a central location.
		KPIS for network servers:
		1. Network connections status
		2. Network connection speed
		3. Number of connections on the network
		4. Packet loss & data transmission errors.
		5. Latency or throughput
		6. Bandwidth utilization



In Nginx, the **minimal severity level** refers to the threshold level of logging that determines which types of error messages are recorded in the error log. The severity levels in Nginx are, in order of increasing severity:

1. **debug** - Detailed debugging information.
2. **info** - Informational messages.
3. **notice** - Normal but significant conditions.
4. **warn** - Warning conditions.
5. **error** - Error conditions that might still allow the application to continue running.
6. **crit** - Critical conditions.
7. **alert** - Action must be taken immediately.
8. **emerg** - The system is unusable.

### **Minimal Severity Level**
When you set the minimal severity level in the `error_log` directive, Nginx logs messages at that level and above. For example, if you set it to `warn`:

```nginx
error_log logs/error.log warn;
```

This configuration means that Nginx will log messages with a severity level of `warn`, `error`, `crit`, `alert`, and `emerg`. Messages with a lower severity than `warn` (like `notice`, `info`, and `debug`) will not be logged.

### **Difference Between `error` and `warn`**

- **`error` level**: 
  - Logs only error messages, which are events that indicate a failure but do not necessarily stop the server from functioning.
  - Errors typically indicate issues that need attention but allow the service to continue running (e.g., a failed request due to a client error).

- **`warn` level**:
  - Logs both warnings and errors. 
  - Warnings are less severe than errors; they indicate potentially problematic situations that donâ€™t necessarily cause immediate failure but could lead to issues if not addressed (e.g., deprecated features, unusual traffic patterns).
  - By logging warnings, you gain insight into conditions that might lead to errors or suboptimal performance in the future.

### **What Happens if You Use This Configuration?**
If you configure Nginx with `error_log logs/error.log warn;`, Nginx will log all warning messages and any more severe messages (error, crit, alert, and emerg). This means you'll get a more comprehensive set of logs, helping you catch potential issues early, before they escalate into errors.

**In Summary:**
- Setting the minimal severity level to `warn` instead of `error` allows you to capture warnings in your logs in addition to errors.
- This can be useful for proactive monitoring, as warnings might indicate issues that could become more serious over time.
- However, this might also result in a larger log file, as more messages will be recorded.

This configuration is useful when you want to monitor the server more closely and catch potential problems before they become critical.
