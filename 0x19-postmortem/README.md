SUMMARY:

As our systems grow in scale and complexity, failures will inevitably happen.

Such failures should be viewed as a learning opportunity:
	An opportunity to uncover vulnerabilities in our system
	An opportunity to prevent repeat incidents and reduce MTTR.
	An opportunity to bring your teams together and plan for how they can be better next time.

An incident postmortem or a post incident review is the best way to walk through what happened in an incident,
and capture any lessons learned.
	1. Why the incident happened.
	2. Its impact
	3. Actions taken to mitigate and resolve it
	4. What should be done to prevent it from happening again.

An incident postmortem is a framework for learning from incidents and turning problems into progress.
It builds trust with customers, colleagues, end users and lets them know the team is working to minimize future incidents and impact.
